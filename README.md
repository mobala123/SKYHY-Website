Developed an interactive e-commerce website for SKYHY Nutrition Lounge, a fictional brand offering nutritious drinks like smoothies, teas, and coffee. The site allows users to browse a dynamic menu, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. Leveraged HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including localStorage for cart persistence) to create an engaging and functional user experience.
